### **Troubleshooting**

#### **If Content Moderation Fails:**
1. **Check Firebase Functions:** Ensure `moderateTreeHoleContent` is deployed
2. **Check Authentication:** Ensure user is logged in
3. **Check Console:** Look for specific error messages
4. **Fallback Behavior:** Content should still be saved if moderation fails

#### **Common Issues:**
- **"Cannot read properties of undefined"**: Fixed by using `authComputed.user.value?.uid`
- **"Content moderation service unavailable"**: Cloud Functions not deployed or network issue
- **"Missing or insufficient permissions"**: Firebase security rules need updating

---

### **Admin Dashboard Integration**

#### **View Moderation Statistics:**
1. Login as admin (admin@admin.com / 1234)
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Check "Tree Hole Posts" section for:
   - Total posts count
   - Moderation status distribution
   - Risk level analysis

#### **Monitor Content Health:**
- **Approved Posts**: Should show in TreeHole feed
- **Rejected Posts**: Not visible to users
- **Needs Revision**: May appear if user chose to submit anyway
